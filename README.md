qPLM tools in R

microTransit provides a set R language tools for building and analyzing quantitative polarized light microscopy (qPLM) data.

A manuscript that describes the basis and utility of several of the functions in this package is currently in review. Please feel free to use the tools in the meantime; I'll update the package with citation info when it becomes available.
