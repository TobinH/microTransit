Quantitative Polarized Light Microscopy Tools in R

The microTransit package provides a set R language tools for importing and analyzing quantitative polarized light microscopy (qPLM) data.

The source package for microTransit is available as a tar.gz file available under 'Releases'.   

A manuscript that describes the basis and utility of several of the functions in this package is currently in review. Please feel free to use the tools in the meantime; I'll update the package with citation info when it becomes available.
