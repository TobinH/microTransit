Description: This package provides tools for measuring, analyzing, and illustrating 
    3D orientation with transmitted polarized light. The tools in this package were 
    designed for the analysis of bone and connective tissue by microscopy on thin 
    sections, but the basic functions can be extended to assess orientation in any 
    birefringent material.
