#' microTransit: R tools for Quantitative Polarized Light Microscopy (qPLM).
#'
#' \pkg{microTransit} provides tools for measuring, analyzing, and illustrating
#' 3D orientation with transmitted polarized light. The tools in this package
#' were designed for the analysis of bone and connective tissue by microscopy on
#' thin sections, but the basic functions can be extended to assess orientation
#' in any birefringent material.
